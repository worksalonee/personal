# LoveProject
To Neil, the one who holds my heart.

Even though miles separate us, my thoughts are always with you. This webpage is a little piece of my love—a place where I’ve poured my heart to remind you how deeply you’re cherished. Every word, every color, and every detail is a reflection of the joy and light you bring to my life.

I built this for you because when I can’t hold your hand, I want to hold your heart in other ways. Here’s a digital hug, a kiss, and a whisper that says, “I love you” in every pixel.

Until we’re together again, let this be a reminder that no distance can dim what we share.

Forever yours,
Salonee
